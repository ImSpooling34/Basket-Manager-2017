Potential: will be basing off this criteria:
6:Low tier role player
7:Mid to High tier role player with minimum star potential
8:Star player or rookie with star potential
9:Superstar, Rookie with immense potential, retiring future hall of famer
Offensive Ratings:
Exterior Shot: based off players shooting splits and shot attempts, volume shooters with good percentages will be favored over high percentage shooters on less shots
Free Throw: based off percentages and attempts
Interior Shot: based on amount of shots that the player takes Russell Westbrook would have a higher rating even if his conversion splits aren't as good as say Kyrie Irving
Defenseive Ratings:
Physique: Based on players healh
Rebounding and Block: based on stats
Steals: Based on SPG and total amount of steals
This will be my criteria for rating, based on a players build that is what will be favored when they are rated Russell Westbrrok will have good all around stats but his shooting ratings will be very low,
